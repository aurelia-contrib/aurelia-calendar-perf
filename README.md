regarding the post 
https://itnext.io/angular-5-vs-react-vs-vue-6b976a3f9172

here is the reimplemented scenario in aurelia
with angular repo as a basis

[https://github.com/mikpetr/angular-performance-test](https://github.com/mikpetr/angular-performance-test)
[https://github.com/mikpetr/react-performance-test](https://github.com/mikpetr/react-performance-test)
[https://github.com/mikpetr/vue-performance-test](https://github.com/mikpetr/vue-performance-test)



To give some basis:
For react sample my timing is 4081ms compared to articles 1819ms

For aurelia implementation
My timing is 850ms


I did not optimize this.
Any misimplementations are not intentional
